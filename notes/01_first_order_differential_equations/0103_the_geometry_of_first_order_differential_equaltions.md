13\. Prove that the initial-value problem
$$
\begin{aligned}
y' = x\sin (x + y), y(0) = 1
\end{aligned}
$$
has a unique solution.

14\. Use the existence and uniqueness theorem to prove that $y(x) = 3$ is the only solution to the initial-value problem.
$$
\begin{aligned}
y' = \frac{x}{x^2 + 1} (y^2-9), y(0) = 3
\end{aligned}
$$

15\. Do you think that the initial-value problem
$$
\begin{aligned}
y' = xy^{1/2}, y(0) = 0
\end{aligned}
$$
has a unique solution? Justify your answer.
