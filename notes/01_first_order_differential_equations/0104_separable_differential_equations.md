### 1.4 Separable Differential Equations

A first-order differential equation is called **separable** if it can be written in the form
$$
\begin{aligned}
\tag{1.4.1} p(y)\frac{dy}{dx} = q(x)
\end{aligned}
$$
If $p(y)$ and $q(x)$ are continuous, then Euqation (1.4.1) has the general solution
$$
\begin{aligned}
\tag{1.4.2} \int p(y)dy = \int q(x)dx + c
\end{aligned}
$$
where $c$ is an arbitrary constant.
