### 1.1 Differential Equations Everywhere

+ A **differential equations** is any equation that involves one or more derivatives of an unknown function. For example:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\tag{1.1.1} \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + x^2 \frac{dy}{dx} + y^2 = 5\sin x\\
\end{aligned}
$$

+ **Dependent variable** and **Independent variable**
+ Differential equations such as (1.1.1) in which the unkown function depends only on a single independent varibale are called **ordinary differential equations**.
+ By contrast, the differential equation involves _partial_ derivatives of the unknown functions of two independent variables  are **called partial differential equations**. Example (Laplace's Equations)
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} = 0
\end{aligned}
$$
