### 0302 Properties of Determinants
Props:
1. Let $A$ has a row or column o f 0s, then $|A| = 0$.
2. If $A$ is a triangular matrix, then $|A| = $ products of diagonals.
3. $|AB| = |A| |B|$
4. $\d |A^{-1}| = \frac{1}{|A|}$
5. $|A^T| = |A|$
6. $|cA| = c^n |A|$ (where $A$ is $n \times n$)
7. $A$ is invertible iff $|A| \ne 0$
