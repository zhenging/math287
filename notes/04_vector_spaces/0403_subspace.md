### 0403 Subspace

#### Subspace
Let $S$ be a **nonempty subset** of a vector space $V$. If $S$ is itself a vector space under the same operations of addition and scalar multiplcation as used in $V$, then we say that $S$ is a **subspace** of $V$.

**Theorem 4.3.2**
Let $S$ be a **nonempty subset** of a vector space $V$. Then $S$ is a subspace of $V$ **if and only if** $S$ is cloded under the operations of addition and scalar multiplcation as used in $V$.

**Zero Vector Check**
If a subset of $S$ of a vector space $V$ fails to contain the zero vector $\bold{0}$, then it cannot form a subspace.

#### Nullspace
Let $A$ be an $m \times n$ matrix. The solution set to the corresponding Homogeneous linear system $A \bold{x} = \bold{0}$ is called the null space of A and is denoted $\bold{nullspace}(A)$. Thus
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{nullspace}(A) = \{\bold{x} \in \Complex^n: A\bold{x} = 0\}
\end{aligned}
$$

$\bold{nullspace}(A)$ is a subspace of $\R^n$.
