### 6.5 The Matrix of a Linear Transformation

Let $V$ and $W$ be vector spaces, with ordered bases $B=\{v_1, v_2, \cdots v_n\}$ and $C=\{w_1, w_2, \cdots w_n\}$, respectively.

Let $T:V \to W$ be a linear transformation
The $m\times n$ matrix
$$
\begin{aligned}
[T]_B^C = \big[ [T(v_1)]_c, [T(v_2)]_c, \cdots [T(v_n)]_c,\big]
\end{aligned}
$$
is called the **matrix representation of $T$ relative to the base $B$ and $C$**.

If $T:V = \R^n$ and $W = \R^m$ are each equipped with the standard bases, then $[T]_B^C$ is just the matrix of $T$ defined earlier.

If $V=W$ and $T(v) = v$ for all $v$ in $V$, then $[T]_B^C$ is just the change of basis matrix from $B$ to $C$ defined earlier.

$[T(v)]_C = [T]_B^C[v]_B$
